Feedback: 

Good .gitignore! Other teams missed this. 

Unfortunately, you forgot to add your images folder as exceptions to .gitignore so the images did not push to whitgit. Fortunately, I saw your images in the final presentation so I only took off 2 points (-2 pts).

Would have been good if the patterns to guess could have been set randomly.

Comments were very good except became weaker near the end of your patternGuesser.vhd file (-1 pt).
